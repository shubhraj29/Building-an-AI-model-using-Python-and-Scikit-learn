# Building-an-AI-model-using-Python-and-Scikit-learn

This repository is completed by me for academic, and self learning purposes.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only and taken from cognitiveclass.ai_

The project is about how to create and run a classification model. The data set contains information about customers of an online trading platform and the data set will be used to classify whether a given customer's probability of churn will be high, medium, or low. 

## The project covers the following steps:
 - Data exploration
 - Data preprocessing
 - Splitting data for training and testing
 - Preparing a classification model
 - Assembling all of the steps using pipeline
 - Training the model
 - Running predictions on the model
 - Evaluating and visualizing model performance

## The following libraries will be used:

 - pandas for managing the data.
 - numpy for mathematical operations.
 - sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
 - seaborn for visualizing the data.
 - matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
